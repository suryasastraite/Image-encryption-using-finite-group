# Image-encryption-using-finite-group
Image information security is an essential component of the network information security field. The main task image cryptography is exploring the image cryptosystem with high processing speed and strong security. The existing text cryptography standard algorithms, such as AES, need to work in the cipher block-chain (CBC) mode to encrypt images.  Thus, the security of a whole cipher image is only the same as that of the first block, and the transmission speed of cipher images is limited by the encryption speed of each block. Then, it is necessary to study the image-oriented encryption algorithm from the perspective of the image rather than text to implement the high-speed encryption and transmission. This project studied the confusion and diffusion of images based on the finite group algorithm and then proposed a new uniform image cryptosystem which shares the encryption and decryption processes. This project also suggests keystream expansion algorithm based on variable length key.
